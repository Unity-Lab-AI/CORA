In human terms: Do whatever the fuck you want with this code. Fork it, mod it,
sell it, tattoo it on your ass - we don't care. Just keep the copyright notice
attached so people know where this beautiful disaster came from.

If it breaks your shit, that's on you. We built CORA to be awesome, not to hold
your hand when you do something stupid with it.
