## So You Wanna Contribute?

Hell yeah. We love that energy. Here's how to not fuck it up.

---

## Before You Start

1. **Join the Discord**: https://discord.gg/D33Bk6Ay
   - Say hi
   - Tell us what you're thinking
   - Get feedback before you spend 40 hours on something we won't merge

2. **Check existing issues**: Someone might already be working on it

3. **Read the codebase**: Understand before you modify

---

## The Rules

### Code Style

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8 but don't be annoying about it
- **JavaScript**: Semicolons optional, consistency required
- **Comments**: Explain the WHY, not the WHAT
- **Variable names**: Be descriptive, not clever

### Commit Messages

Good:
```
Fix camera feed freezing on modal close
Add 30s timeout to Kokoro TTS
```

Bad:
```
fixed stuff
updates
asdfasdf
```

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch (`feature/cool-thing`)
3. Make your changes
4. Test your shit locally
5. Submit PR with clear description
6. Wait for review (we're busy but we'll get to it)

---

## What We Want

### High Priority
- Bug fixes (always welcome)
- Performance improvements
- New tool integrations
- Voice/TTS improvements
- UI/UX enhancements

### Medium Priority
- Documentation improvements
- Code cleanup/refactoring
- New features (discuss first)

### Low Priority
- Cosmetic changes
- Opinionated restructuring
- "Best practices" rewrites that don't add value

---

## What We DON'T Want

- AI safety lectures (CORA is uncensored by design)
- Corporate sanitization of the personality
- Breaking changes without discussion
- Dependencies that bloat the install
- Features nobody asked for

---

## Testing

We don't do unit tests. We code it right the first time.

But DO:
- Actually run the code before submitting
- Test on Windows (primary platform)
- Check both web and desktop versions if applicable
- Verify nothing else broke

---

## Review Process

1. We'll look at your PR when we can
2. We might ask for changes
3. Don't take feedback personally
4. Once approved, we'll merge it

If we're slow to respond, ping us on Discord. We're human.

## Recognition

Contributors get:
- Credit in the changelog
- Our eternal gratitude
- Bragging rights
- Maybe a shoutout on Discord

---

## Code of Conduct

Don't be a dick. That's it. That's the whole code of conduct.

More specifically:
- Be respectful in discussions
- Give constructive feedback
- Don't harass other contributors
- Keep drama out of the repo
