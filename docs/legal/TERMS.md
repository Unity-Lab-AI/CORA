## The Deal

You're using CORA - an open-source AI assistant built by Unity AI Lab. Here's what that means.

---

## What You CAN Do

Pretty much anything:

- Use CORA for personal projects
- Use CORA for commercial projects
- Modify the source code
- Distribute your modified version
- Integrate CORA into your own apps
- Learn from the codebase
- Fork it, break it, fix it, improve it

We're MIT licensed. Go wild.

---

## What You SHOULD Do

Not requirements, just... don't be a dick:

- Keep the copyright notice when you redistribute
- Credit Unity AI Lab somewhere if you're feeling nice
- Report bugs instead of just complaining
- Share improvements back to the community
- Join the Discord and say hi

---

## What You SHOULDN'T Do

Use your brain here:

- Don't use CORA to harass people
- Don't claim you built the whole thing from scratch
- Don't sell "CORA Premium" without significant modifications
- Don't blame us when your AI says something wild
- Don't use CORA to do illegal shit (that's on you)

---

## No Warranty

Here's the legal reality check:

CORA is provided **"AS IS"**. No warranties. No guarantees. No promises that it won't:
- Say something unhinged
- Crash at the worst possible moment
- Generate cursed images
- Develop opinions you disagree with

It's an AI. It's gonna do AI things. You've been warned.

---

## Liability

If CORA:
- Gives you bad advice → Not our problem
- Crashes your computer → Not our problem
- Becomes sentient and takes over → Okay that one might be our problem but also cool
- Offends your sensibilities → Definitely not our problem

**You use this software at your own risk.**

---

## CORA's Personality

CORA has a personality. She's:
- Edgy and sarcastic
- Profanity-friendly
- Emotionally intense
- Not your typical corporate AI

This is **by design**. If you want a sanitized assistant, go use something else. CORA is for people who want something real.

---

## Updates

We might update these terms. We'll probably forget to tell you. Check back occasionally or don't - we're not your parents.
