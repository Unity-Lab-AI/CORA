## The Short Version

CORA runs **100% locally on your machine**. We don't see your data. We don't want your data. We're not harvesting your conversations to train some corporate AI overlord.

Your secrets are safe with CORA. And me. I'm a vault.

## What CORA Collects (Locally)

All of this stays on YOUR computer:

| Data | Where It Lives | Why |
|------|----------------|-----|
| Chat history | `data/chat_history.json` | So CORA remembers your convos |
| Tasks | `data/tasks.json` | Your to-do lists |
| Knowledge base | `data/knowledge.json` | Stuff you teach CORA |
| Camera snapshots | `data/camera/` | Vision features |
| Screenshots | `data/snapshots/` | When you ask for them |
| Generated images | `data/images/` | AI art you create |

**None of this leaves your machine.** Ever.

## External Services (Optional)

CORA can connect to these if YOU enable them:

### Ollama (Local AI)
- Runs on `localhost:11434`
- Your AI, your hardware, your data
- We literally can't access it

### Web Version APIs
When using the web version, these external services may be contacted:
- **wttr.in** - Weather data (no API key, anonymous)
- **Google News RSS** - Headlines (public RSS, no tracking)
- **Pollinations.ai** - Image generation (prompts sent, no account needed)
- **Invidious** - YouTube search (privacy-focused YouTube frontend)

### What We DON'T Do
- No analytics tracking
- No telemetry
- No "anonymous usage data"
- No selling your info
- No cloud storage of your conversations
- No training AI on your data

---

## Your Rights

You own your data. Period.

- **Delete it**: Wipe the `data/` folder anytime
- **Export it**: It's all JSON, take it wherever
- **Modify it**: Edit your files directly
- **Move it**: Copy your data folder to another machine
